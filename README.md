# Artspiration

Welcome to Artspiration, your personal virtual art gallery!

Once you have signed up and logged in, you are able to search for artwork by artist, genre, or artwork title.  While browsing through your search results, you can "heart" your favourite pieces to add them to your own artwork collections.  You can also browse through your collections, or view them in "Gallery Mode", as well as gain valuable information about the artwork and artists in your collections. 

We hope you also enjoy suggested pieces of art based on your searches and collections as well as our "Artwork of the Day" presented on our Home Page.
